# Systems Programming Exercise Directory

This repository contains a collection of systems programming exercises designed to practice C programming and reinforce concepts like memory management, data structures, low-level programming, and similar. Each exercise is self-contained within its own directory, complete with implementation files, test suites, and documentation.

\* Topic "Implementation" refers to exercise which heavily focus on building data structures or algorithms from scratch, rather than solely testing theoretical knowledge.

## Project Structure

Each directory follows a standardized layout for ease of use:
* `lib.h`: The public interface and function prototypes you must implement.
* `lib.c`: Your implementation file.
* `test.c`: The automated test suite using the **Greatest** framework.
* `Makefile`: Build automation for the specific exercise.
* `README.md`: Specific goals, requirements, and logic explanations.

## Quick Start

To work on an exercise, navigate to its directory, complete the exercise in `lib.c` and use `make` to compile the tests:

```bash
cd vector
# edit lib.c to implement the required functionality
make run
```
